                        I was tasked with the performance optimization and rendering budget management for our
                        highstreet Metaverse VR project. thie project consists of diverse otherwordly looking biomes and 
                        scenes making the requirement more diverse and therefor needing dynamic solutions. SO to
                        satisfy such requiremnets I desided to enforce the use of LOD all throught the project for 
                        all the mesh assets used. Which for the most part keept the performance to playable range of 72-60 fps
                        but soon we started noticing that the performance rappidly droping once we designe and setup a forest environemnt
                        with lots of vegitation and folliage. which dropped the performance to around 35-40 fps and sometimes even reduced 
                        to ~15 fps. which naturally raised concerns in me and I went on researching how to tackle this performance issus
                        as if we experience this for such a scale, then down the line, rendering the scene will become almost impossible.
                    </p>

                So I went on researching on how to solve newely faced challange of rendering large number of objects
                in the VR scene. So in my research I came across many suggestions but most were faling into those things
                that I have implimented already. things like use of LODs, use of optimized shaders, smaller scenes(not possible in
                our case as our game is an MMO!!) and use of imposters. So I have suggested the use of Imposters once before and 
                the team quickly responded to me with the  remark that they have already tried Amplyfy imposter in VR
                and it wan not performing well and were giving them issues.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    And at this point where reducing the number of tri count bacame soo crutial there aint much I can do
                    but too look for ways to do exactly that. So thats where I began researching how to make an imposter system 
                    myself. The concept is quite simple, what we simply have to do is render images of the mesh from multipple angle
                    and project in onto a Quad. The method is extremely effect for reducing the poly count and produce a convincing result
                    expecially while viewed from a further distance and plus as we view it in VR we get to see a much blured out or 
                    softer verssion from a distance. which works great for my case.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I initially started off my making a capture tool that goes around the model and captures the mesh from multipple angle
                    and save it to a texture.
                    </p>
                    <div class="blog-inline-media-container">

                    <p>
                        Once I found the capturing was working I went on look for ways to combine it into one Atlas texture.
                        combining was straight-forward actually. all you have to do is generate an array of textures and then make
                        a large texture with the dimensions equal to the quare-root of the number of textures and them multiply it by the
                        texture width giving you the size of the atlas texture. then using a forloop and draw the render into 
                        the atlas texture.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once combined I passed in into the shader that have created to pick and display the correct
                        image form the atlas grid based on the viewsing angle and the result will look as follows.

                <p>
                    Once i compleated this phase i further went on improving aspects such as blending the images from one
                    to the next, making it responsive to directional light. and not to mention the part that I have to improve
                    the rendering system to render the normals and albedo seprately so that it can be combined later in the shader
                    appropriately to maintain the illussion of directional lighting and surface carvatures. the finiched result can be seen in the 
                    video poseted blow.
