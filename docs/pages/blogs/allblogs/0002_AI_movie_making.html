                    <p>
                        in the year of our lord 2024, what is all that is talked about if not AI generated content and
                        the
                        future of art and creative industries once dominated by human creativity and artistry. This is
                        all I been
                        seeing for months and months without end, but I never fet it was good enough to worth my persuit
                        as the quality
                        appears alwaty lacking in precession or even anything remotely toleerable to say the least,
                        untill very recently.
                        It seem like in the past 6 months there seem to be more involvement and attention by bigger
                        companies as well as
                        startups attemptenibg to make realtime video generation AI, realtinme Game AI etc. so to me its
                        a turn in the right direction.
                        A step to the next phace of AI conquest, where it will soon dominate the creative industry as
                        well.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        So I decided to try it out for the first time and here are the steps.
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>you generate an image generateion prompt using LLM(large language model) like ChatGPT,
                            Nemotron or Claud</li>
                        <li>then you can us the prompt on Image generation diffussion model provided by any service out
                            there
                            like OpenArt, Deepia, Adobe AI, Midjourney or Stable Diffussion</li>
                        <li>Finally, you take the image and pass it through an video generation AI like Minmax,
                            Runway or Krea as the starting frame and pass in prompts to guide the video generation</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        to start off I had decided to go with ChatGpt to generate prompts for generation images
                        and whatever text generation is required and to maintain consistency through the image
                        generation
                        regarding the style and the theme of each generated images.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        first of all I went to google images to find an image that displays the style and vibe I was
                        looking for
                        in my "Movie". anything that closely resemble to your vision. I was looking up film Noir movie
                        scenes.
                    </p>
                    <div class="blog-inline-media-container">
                        <img src="../../../images/blogs/AI_Movie_2024/image_02.gif" alt="LOD used for trees">
                    </div>
                    <p>

                        then I copied one of the images and pased it onto ChatGPT and asked it to give me a promt so
                        that
                        I can pass it into an image generator and generate images with similar style
                    </p>
                    <div class="blog-inline-media-container">
                        <img src="../../../images/blogs/AI_Movie_2024/image_01.gif" alt="LOD used for trees">
                    </div>


                    <p>
                        Once I extracted the style of the image and the overall aesthestics of the image using chatgpt.
                        I was looking around
                        to find a free AI image generateor as I assumed it takes a lot of generations to get my images
                        right to how I wanted.
                        Lucky i found <a href="https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text2img"
                            target="_blank">deepai.org image generator</a> which allow me
                        to generate an indefinite amount of images for absolutely free. which I used to make several
                        images for the same prompt
                        to get the best one and to roughely maintain consistency at least in in terms of noticable
                        visial elements
                    </p>
                    <div class="blog-inline-media-container">
                        <img src="../../../images/blogs/AI_Movie_2024/image_03.gif" alt="Amplify Shader Image">
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Once I was satisfied with the result. I went to the new Chinese made free to use AI video
                        generator
                        <a href="https://hailuoai.video/" target="_blank">hailuoai</a> by Minmax. which produces
                        impressive results
                        all for absolutely free of charge.
                    </p>
                    <div class="blog-inline-media-container">
                        <img src="../../../images/blogs/AI_Movie_2024/image_04.gif" alt="Amplify Shader Image">
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        I mostly let the AI deside to generate on its own and not guide it except for a few cases. but I
                        must say
                        Minmax offers much more control over how its looks compared to the image generation stage.
                    </p>
                    <div class="blog-inline-media-container">

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        and Finally after making several images to fill out the content of my somewhat spontaneous
                        story-board. I downloaded them all and
                        stiched them togather using CapCut
                    </p>
                    <div class="blog-inline-media-container">
                        <img src="../../../images/blogs/AI_Movie_2024/image_05.gif" alt="Noir AI Animation">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Here is the stiched up videos uploaded to Youtube with added Noir Jazz music so it flows well
                        like a trailer. I feel like it went well for a
                        first project as a test run. there are lot more to improve expecially in aspects that determines
                        consistency.
                    </p>
